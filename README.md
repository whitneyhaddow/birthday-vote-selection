# birthday-vote-selection
A simple ASP.NET website that allows users to vote on possible dates for a birthday party. This project was done for a class I took.

Documentation on dynamic date selection [here](http://whitneyhaddow.com/2015/04/29/how-to-provide-date-selections-dynamically-on-the-net-calendar-control/)
and on the forced selection custom validator [here](http://whitneyhaddow.com/2015/04/29/using-the-asp-net-custom-validator-with-the-calendar-control/).
